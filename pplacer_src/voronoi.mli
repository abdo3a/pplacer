(** Voronoi diagrams for phylogenetic trees with input set leaves.
 *
 * "Marks" are where colors are changed in the diagram, and colors flow up the
 * tree. That is, a mark sets the color of all edges proximal to that mark until
 * another mark is encountered.
 *
 * We only care about VDs when the set of interesting points are leaves or some
 * subset thereof. Thus we have at most one boundary per edge, as when the
 * points of interest are nodes of the phylogenetic tree.

(** Generate a map from each id in a Newick_gtree.t to a list of (neighbor_id,
    distance) pairs for every neighboring node for the given node, where the
    distance is the edge length between the two nodes. The parent of a node
    counts as a neighbor. *)

(** Given an ldistm, a set of currently valid leaves, the leaves at which to
    start updating, and a tree on which the leaves are placed, update the
    ldistm to reflect only the valid leaves. *)

    specified. *)

(** This function returns the updated Voronoi after removing all of the leaves
    in the given set, as well as the set of leaves which were affected by this

(** Effectively fold over the edge_snipl defined below, but we don't have to

(** Get a list of the edge_snips that are of the given leaf in v. *)

(** Find the snip in the list which covers the specified position. *)

(** Find all of the snips on the tree of a voronoi diagram. *)

val partition_indiv_on_leaves: v -> Mass_map.Indiv.t -> Mass_map.Indiv.t IntMap.t
(** Given a voronoi diagram and mass map, generate a map from leaves to mass
    maps containing only the mass on that leaf. *)

val distribute_mass: v -> Mass_map.Indiv.t -> float list IntMap.t
(** Given a voronoi diagram and mass map, distribute the mass onto all of the
    leaves in the diagram. The result maps leaf numbers to a lists of all mass
    placed onto that leaf. *)

(** Find the distance from the specified placement to the closest leaf on a

    the specified diagram. *)
