|rppr| is a binary to help prepare reference packages and select sequences.
It's pronounced "ripper" and is short for Reference Package PReparer.
"Evaluator" might be a more appropriate descriptor than "preparer", but acronym aesthetics won out over precision here.


Usage
=====

Command line interface
----------------------
The general way to invoke |rppr| is ``rppr COMMAND [options] placefile[s]`` where COMMAND is one of the |rppr| commands.
For example::

  rppr info -c some.refpkg

These programs are listed with more detail below, and can always be found using ``rppr --cmds`` .

|rppr| can also be invoked as ``rppr --quiet COMMAND [...]``,  which prevents
the specified command from writing to stdout unless explicitly requested.
