Draw a "heat tree" in phyloXML format.
A heat tree shows the optimal movement of dirt in the "earth movers" interpretation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.
Imagine that the dirt is moving from the placement distribution corresponding to the first place file to that in the second.
The branches are thickened in proportion to the amount of dirt which moves through that edge.
Dirt moving on an edge towards the root is marked in red, and that moving away from the root is colored in blue.
Said another way, clades which are highly represented in the first sample but not the second are colored red, and the others blue.
