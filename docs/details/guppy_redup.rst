From placefiles generated by running ``pplacer`` on a deduplicated sequence
file, restore duplicated sequences to the placefiles.

``seqmagick`` can be used to easily deduplicate sequence files and produce
dedup files for use with ``guppy redup``::

    seqmagick convert --deduplicated-sequences-file=sample.dedup sample.fasta sample_deduped.fasta
    pplacer -c sample.refpkg sample_deduped.fasta
    guppy redup -d sample.dedup --prefix reduped_ sample_deduped.jplace

The format for dedup files is very simple, for ease of reading and writing.
Each dedup file is just a CSV file with three columns: the sequence name in the
deduplicated file, the name to put in the reduplicated file, and the mass
associated with the latter name. For most purposes, the ingoing mass will
simply be the number of reads. For example with the following dedup file::

    A_0,A_0,1
    A_0,A_1,3
    A_0,A_2,1
    B_0,B_0,1
    C_0,C_0,2
    C_0,C_1,2

For one set of name/mass pairs, the transformation done is::

    [A_0, 1] -> [A_0, 1; A_1, 3; A_2, 1]
    [B_0, 1] -> [B_0, 1]
    [C_0, 1] -> [C_0, 2; C_1, 2]

And a more complicated example::

    [A_0, 2; B_0, 1] -> [A_0, 2; A_1, 6; A_2, 2; B_0, 1]
    [C_0, 0.5] -> [C_0, 1; C_1, 1]
    [D_0, 1] -> [D_0, 1]

Sequences with no changes need not be present in the dedup file.
