Say that two pqueries overlap if there is an edge such that the two pqueries both put mass on that edge.
Define the overlap graph to be the graph with nodes being pqueries and edges signifying overlap.
Call the connected components of the overlap graph *islands*.

That is, islands are maximal sets of pqueries with no edge-mass overlap between sets.
