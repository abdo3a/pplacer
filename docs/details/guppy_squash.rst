Perform `squash clustering`_.

Bootstrapping is performed by resampling directly on placements.
Note that the bootstrap values for clustering are calculated in a rooted way.
That means that you may observe different bootstrap values on either side of the root, especially if a whole clade from one side of the root likes to flip to a location distal to the clade on the other side of the root.
