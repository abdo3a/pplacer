The overlap of a pair of pqueries is defined to be the inner product of their
likelihood weight ratios (or posterior probabilities) as indexed by tree edges.

This subcommand outputs all nonzero overlaps between pqueries in the form::

    pquery_1 pquery_2 inner_product

which is a specification of the weighted edges of a graph with pqueries as vertices.
